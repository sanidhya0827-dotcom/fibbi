# fibbi — market-test storefront (React + Supabase)

A fake-door smoke-test store: everything works, the cart works, checkout ends at a
believable **out of stock** wall that captures restock emails. Every intent signal
is written to Supabase so you can measure real demand before making the product.

## Stack

- Vite + React 18 + react-router-dom
- Supabase (Postgres) — two tables: `leads`, `events`, insert-only RLS
- No backend server needed; deploys as a static SPA (Vercel config included)

## 1 · Supabase setup (5 minutes)

1. Create a project at supabase.com.
2. Open **SQL Editor** → paste and run `supabase/schema.sql`.
3. Go to **Project Settings → API** and copy the *Project URL* and *anon public key*.

The schema creates:

| table | what lands here |
|---|---|
| `leads` | emails — `source` is `restock` (out-of-stock capture) or `waitlist` (home page) |
| `events` | funnel analytics: `page_view`, `add_to_cart`, `checkout_attempt`, `oos_shown`, `quiz_complete`, `pin_check`, `game_score`, `lead_saved` |

RLS allows the public anon key to **insert only** — visitors can never read data.
Each visitor gets a `session_id` (localStorage UUID) so you can compute
per-session funnel conversion. A ready `funnel_daily` view is included.

## 2 · Run locally

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # paste your Supabase URL + anon key
npm install
npm run dev
```

No `.env`? The app still runs — Supabase calls become console no-ops (demo mode).

## 3 · Deploy (Vercel)

```bash
npm i -g vercel && vercel
```

- Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` as environment variables in the Vercel project.
- `vercel.json` already rewrites all routes to `index.html` (SPA).
- Point a real domain at it before running ads — in-app browsers show the URL bar.

## 4 · Before spending on ads

- [ ] Paste your **Meta Pixel** base code into `index.html` (placeholder comment in `<head>`), then mirror the key events:
      `AddToCart` where `add_to_cart` fires, `InitiateCheckout` on `checkout_attempt`, `Lead` on `lead_saved`.
- [ ] Replace the three photo placeholders in `src/components/PhotoStack.jsx` with real images (`/public/img/…`).
- [ ] Update contact details in `Footer.jsx` / `Policies.jsx`.
- [ ] Keep the site unlisted (no SEO push) while testimonials are illustrative.

## 5 · Reading the results

The metric that matters: **checkout_attempt / sessions**. On cold Meta traffic,
3–5%+ is a strong buy signal for this category. `add_to_cart / sessions` above
8–10% says the offer works even if checkout intent is thinner. Restock leads are
your launch list — mail them first when batch 001 actually exists.

```sql
-- overall funnel
select * from funnel_daily;

-- which SKUs get added
select payload->>'sku' as sku, count(*) 
from events where event = 'add_to_cart' 
group by 1 order by 2 desc;

-- quiz gap distribution
select payload->>'gap' as gap_g, count(*) 
from events where event = 'quiz_complete' 
group by 1 order by 1::int;
```
