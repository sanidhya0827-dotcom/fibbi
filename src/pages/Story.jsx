            <p><b>Since the 1970s,</b> Indian households have started mornings with isabgol stirred into warm water. It worked. It always worked. It also became shorthand for "uncle behaviour" — the single most effective fiber on the planet, filed under embarrassing.</p>
            <p><b>Meanwhile,</b> a generation raised on gut-health reels pays premium prices for imported prebiotic sodas carrying a fraction of the fiber, because those come in cans that look good on a shelf.</p>
            <p><b>fibbi exists to close that gap.</b> Same clinically proven ingredient your grandparents trusted, re-engineered — baked into crunchy clusters at a real 5g dose with zero added sugar — and designed like something you'd actually post. Made in Pune. Priced for India. No lectures.</p>
